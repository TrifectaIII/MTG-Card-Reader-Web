# MTG-Card-Reader-Web
## Info
v2.0 of [MTG-Card-Reader](https://github.com/TrifectaIII/MTG-Card-Reader), built as a webpage in early but active development. I am actively looking for collaborators on this project, and if you have experience with deployment of python-based web apps, or with web app gui design, feel free to contact me at maddenfong@gmail.com.
